  dialogue: Of course! The flowers, Nancy and Tim, moved in about a year ago with
    their young son Timmy. They're a gorgeous little family, very kind and caring.
    Although I think something is keeping them awake at night because they've been
    looking quite tired recently. Anything else you'd like to know?
