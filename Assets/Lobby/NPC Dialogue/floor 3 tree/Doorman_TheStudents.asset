  dialogue: Ah yes, the university students, Sam, a real sporty boy, Tom, engineering
    I think, very good with machines, and Billy, big into video games and never seems
    to have enough sleep. Those boys are quite loud I've heard, a few residents have
    asked me to have a chat with them actually. Anything else you'd like to know?
