  dialogue: "I need you to follow these instructions very carefully. I can\u2019t
    even trust the mail company, which is why the delivery instructions may seem
    nonsensical. I cannot explain why, but this is a job I can't do myself, so I
    need you to handle it for me. Among those packages is a spirit box; it tunes
    into radio frequencies when it detects paranormal activity. Follow the distortions
    in the sound and leave that package at that location. I will put in a good word
    with your boss. That is the only package I ordered, and I will know if you spend
    unnecessary time in my place. Good luck."
