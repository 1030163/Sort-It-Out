  dialogue: 'Hey champ! Thanks for the package, did it come all right?

    it''s
    a surprise gift for my wife. She didn''t like my last delivery of model trains,
    she says they''re cluttering the apartment.

    Yawn, anyway, I work at the
    flour factory that supplies bakeries around town, but I''ve had a bit of a problem
    recently. Can I ask you for another favor?

    There''s been an awful lot of
    noise coming from the room down the hallway, can you find out what it is and
    sort it out for me?

    Thanks,champ.
